# group_c_property_proj_backend

0. write "npm install" in the terminal to download all needed modules

1. insert .env file with that data:
ATLAS_URI=mongodb+srv://<your-user>:<your-password>@cluster0.aylhq.mongodb.net/myFirstDatabase?retryWrites=true&w=majority
  
SERVER_PORT=8888
  
SECRET=your-secret

2. in group_c_property_proj_backend/server.js edit cors params to your frontend port (for me it was 3009)
3. npm start
4. App listening at http://localhost:8888

Done
